I’ve had an idea for a Warlock Patron rattling around my head for a while and wanted to bring it to life. 
The Gambler
“I was desperate. I had nothing left. It was my last piece of silver, and it was all down to a roll of the dice. I would give anything to win this next round.”

The Gambler Warlock has made a pact with a creature of pure chaos and luck. It could be a demon, a trickster fairy, or a primal spirit that heard the desperate call and decided to offer just 1 more roll of the dice. 

The Gambler Warlock is highly reliant on luck. It’ll give the player some extra chances but if the dice gods aren’t on your side, it could be disastrous.

Borrowed Luck
Level 1: At level 1, the Warlock gains the ability to borrow luck from their future selves. 

The Warlock can reroll a single die for any of their checks. They must use the 2nd roll. 
The next time the Warlock rolls the same dice for any check, they must use the initial roll from earlier. 

Any time the Warlock rolls the same die, the Warlock must use the initial roll. 

Example: The Warlock rolls a “1” to hit using a d20. They use Borrowed Luck to reroll the d20 and roll a “20”. 

During the enemy’s turn, they target the Warlock, and the Warlock must roll a d20 as a saving throw for half damage. They must use the “1” on their d20 roll. 

Changing Luck
Level 10: The Warlock can choose to swap a d20 roll of an ally or an enemy. The <a href="https://gamecows.com/dnd-warlock-5e-class-guide/">Warlock</a> must use the swapped result the next time they roll a d20. This can be done after seeing the initial roll. 

Example: If an allied Paladin character rolls a “5” to hit and misses, the Warlock (with the ally's approval) rolls an “18”. 

The Paladin’s hit roll is then replaced with an 18 and hits. On the Warlock’s turn, they make an attack but must use the previous “5” rolled by the allied Paladin. The Warlock misses. 
Feeling Lucky
14th Level: At level 14, the Warlock can choose to ignore the results of any dice check. Instead, they must flip a coin. If they call it correctly the check succeeds. If they call the coin incorrectly, the check fails. This can be done once per short or long rest.
